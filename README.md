# SHA256-Brute-Force
**Password Hash Cracker**

This repository contains a Python script that attempts to crack a password hash by iterating through a list of passwords and comparing their corresponding hash values to a given target hash.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/cyber-bytezz/password-hash-cracker.git](https://github.com/cyber-bytezz/SHA256-Brute-Force)

cd SHA256-Brute-Force

3. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

4. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the script by providing the target hash as a command-line argument:
